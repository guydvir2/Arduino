# ADS1115_WE
An Arduino library for the 16-bit, 4 channel ADS1115 ADC with gain and alert functions.

I have have tried to optimize the library for convenience to use. If you try the examples I recommend to start with Single_Shot.ino. You'll find more details here soon: https://wolles-elektronikkiste.de/ads1115.

All features of the ADS1115 are implemented, including alert functions. 

If you like the library it would be cool if you can give it a star. If you find bugs, please inform me.
